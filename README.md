## About The Project

An advanced AI-driven question generator capable of creating insightful and contextually relevant questions in multiple languages. Leveraged cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to ensure accuracy and adaptability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. This project involved extensive research, data analysis, and collaboration with cross-functional teams to refine and optimize the AI model.

This application utilizes the powerful PALM architecture to autonomously create questions based on user input text. This multilingual tool interacts smoothly, extracting essential details to craft pertinent questions in multiple languages. By dynamically generating questions, it boosts understanding and engagement, promoting a deeper dive into textual content across different languages.
